    this is a simple level meter that displays on the plasmatrim
    LED strip (http://www.plasmatrim.com/).

    it is currently linux-only, due to the dependence on /dev/hidraw,
    but could be easily ported with, say, signal11's hidapi. the JACk
    dependency may be more difficult to tease out, but you could probably
    shim in any callback-based audio API without too much trouble.

	build with:
		
		./waf configure
		./waf

    use with:
    
        ./analyzer /dev/hidraw{N}

    it will create a JACK port into which audio can be routed.

    feature wishlist:
        * better windowing (i.e. not dependent on blocksize)
        * spectrum analyzer (FFT or wavelet decomposition)
        * EBU R 128 loudness metering
